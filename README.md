## Hypotheses  

Imagine you're at a football game - you want to know how many other people think the Seahawks are going to make a comeback. You ask the question and you're getting responses within a few minutes from people in the same stadium. Every question has to be short and concise. Answers would come in the form of a hybrid multiple choice - you add a short answer, and anyone can agree with you. You can search questions by geolocation or hashtag.
